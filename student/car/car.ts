// **Car Problem**

// Create an interface for a car that has properties for the make, model, and year.
// The interface should also have a method for starting the car.
// Create a class that implements the car interface, and provide an implementation for the start method
// that logs "The car has started" to the console. Create an instance of the car class and call the start method.
