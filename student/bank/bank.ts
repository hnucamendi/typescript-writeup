// **Bank Problem**
// Create a class for a bank account that has properties for the account holder's name, account number, and balance.
// The class should have methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as a method to check the account balance.
// Use type annotations for the properties and methods, and make sure to catch any errors that may occur during the deposit and withdrawal process.

/** Class representing a Bank */

// code here

export default Bank;
