// **Shape Problem**

// Create an interface for a shape with properties for width and height and a method for calculating the area.
// Create two classes that implement the shape interface, one for a rectangle and another for a circle.
// Add type annotations to all properties and methods and make sure to catch any errors that may occur when creating instances of the classes.

/** interface for Shape */

/** Class representing rectangle shape */
