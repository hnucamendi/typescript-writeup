// **Person Problem**

// Create a class for a person that has properties for the person's name, age, and address.
// The class should have a method that takes a string as an argument and returns the person's name and address concatenated together.
// Use type annotations for the properties and method, and make sure to catch any errors that may occur when calling the method.

/** Class representing a Person */

// code here

export default Person;
